## Download Postman

  - Let's us make http request and view responses, to debug when data is not coming back
  as we wanted it to.

  - http request are independent of browsers, something to keep in mind.

  - now if we make a request, go to www.google.com
      - we will be using http verbs to tell the server what to do with the request
      - retrieve is a get request
      - uploading, submmiting, sending data would be a post request
      - put and patch, would be requests to edit or updates
      - delete request, does exactly what it sounds like it.

    - these are all protocol, so if I say this is a delete request, then it will delete.
