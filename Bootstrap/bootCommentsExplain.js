//components:
  // nav bars
  // really cool stuff!


//1st step:
//download bootstrap
  // open file after compressed
  // move bootstrap.css into our directory
  // this will allow us to use all the classes that are included
  // buttons, .btn-danger
  // the . min just opens faster so easier to load but does not matter
  // the cdn also works, its a link to the hosted version of the min-file

  // then go into your html with an href and include bootstrap
