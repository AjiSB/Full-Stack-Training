//DOM:
  // Document object model
    // interface between js and html and compress
    // cool ways to interact


// The browser turns every html tag into a js object
  // load html in browser
  // the dom is created from above
  // it essentially turns every element into js objects
  // behind the scenes it makes a model of every js object

//Document:

//in the console:
// console.dir(document)
  // this another method that will return the entire document object
  // a regular object
    // with a lot of info like fonts, imgs,links, body with props
