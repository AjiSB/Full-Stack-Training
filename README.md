# Internet, how it works?

  - example:
      - someone in England visits a webpage in the states :www.worldsciencefestistival.com
      - their computer asks the worldsciencefestistival server for a copy of the webpage
      - the computer sticks the request into a virtual envelope called a packet
      - the packet is wrapped with specific information about that request including the pages IP
      - the computer sends the packet out of the house and into the street via large underground copper wires
          - it passes through small regional networks before ending up at tele house north in London which is Englands main internet hub
          - the IP address on this packet tells the hub that the worldsciencefestistival server is actually in Los Angeles
